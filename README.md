# Underwater Plastic Pollution Object Detection

![Sample Output](images/sample_output.png)

## Overview

This repository contains code for an object detection model specifically designed to identify and locate underwater trash. The model is built using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/) and is based on the popular [YOLOV8 (You Only Look Once version 8)](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov8/) architecture.

## Dataset

The model is trained on a kaggle data set [Underwater Plastic Pollution Dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnavs19/underwater-plastic-pollution-detection) consisting of underwater images labeled with bounding boxes around various types of trash commonly found in aquatic environments. The dataset is not included in this repository due to its large size and proprietary nature.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Creator-Logs/Object-Detection-Underwater-Plastic-Pollution.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```


## Status

Only a first iteration of the model has been made. More models and comparison coming soon...
